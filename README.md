# Individual Project!
I created a regression model to predict total annual income for hourly workers based on census data and features engineered from clustering. This is an expansion of the original research that was used to create a classification model that predicted whether or not an individual made over 50_000 dollars a year.

## Goals

## Setup this project
* Dependencies
    1. [utilities.py](https://github.com/david-ryan-alviola/utilities/releases)
        * Use release 2.5.1 or greater
    2. python
    3. pandas
    4. scipy
    5. sklearn
    6. numpy
    7. matplotlib.pyplot
    8. seaborn
* Steps to recreate
    1. Clone this repository
    2. Install `utilities.py` according to the instructions
    3. Setup env.py
        * Remove the .dist extension (should result in `env.py`)
        * Fill in your user_name, password, and host
        * If you did not install `utilities.py` in your cloned repository, replace the "/path/to/utilities" string with the path to where `utilities.py` is installed
    4. Open `scratch_notebook.ipynb` and run the cells
